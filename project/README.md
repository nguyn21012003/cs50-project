### Video Demo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGsBpj9mK2Q

## Description

This is my final project for CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python course. A simple program, takes coffee orders from customers, then returns the receipt include coffee name, the price that customers need to pay and size

This program will print out the menu when the customers need to order. The menu is stored at menu.csv, you can easily get it from mockaroo

1. Tabulate.

   ```terminal
   pip install tabulate
   ```

2. Pyfiglet.

   ```terminal
    pip install pyfiglet
   ```

## File structure

```text
ðŸ“¦ FINAL PROJECT
    â”œâ”€Â coffee.py
    â”œâ”€Â test_coffee.py
    â”œâ”€Â menu.csv
    â”œâ”€Â order.csv
    â””â”€Â README.md
```

The coffee.py is a main file. It include 2 features. Firstly, it will print the menu item which stored at menu.csv. Secondly, that will take the order from customers and print the bill

The order from customers will be stored at order.csv.

This concept took idea from the vending machine. It will take one order from customer and print out 1 output. Very simple to do. You can do it by yourself.
